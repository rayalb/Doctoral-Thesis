abstract = {In this paper, we present a new method for estimating the number of terms in a sum of exponentially damped sinusoids embedded in noise. In particular, we propose to combine the shift-invariance property of the Hankel matrix associated with the signal with a constraint over its singular values to penalize small-order estimations. With this new methodology, the algebraic structure of the Hankel matrix and the statistical properties of the noise are considered. The new order estimation technique shows significant improvements over subspace-based methods. In particular, when a good separation between the noise and the signal subspaces is not possible, the new methodology outperforms known techniques. We evaluate the performance of our method using numerical experiments and compare its performance with previous results found in the literature.}

abstract = {Parametric spectral estimation techniques are widely used to estimate the parameters of sums of complex sinusoids corrupted by noise. In this work, the authors show that the numerical stability of the estimated frequencies not only depends on the size of the amplitudes associated with the real frequencies, but also to the distance among frequencies. Therefore, for closely spaced frequencies, the estimates are vulnerable to large deviate from their true values. To overcome this problem, they propose a strategy to artificially increase the frequency separation by downsampling the baseband equivalent of the noisy signal before applying a spectral estimation technique. This methodology significantly improves the estimation performance especially in the low signal to noise ratio regime. The performance of the technique is assessed in terms of the root mean square error and it is compared to results obtained in previous publications.},

This is a generalized version of the well-known spike recovery problem, which is receiving much attention recently. We analyze the numerical conditioning of this problem in two different settings depending on the order of magnitude of the quantity Nη, where N is the number of Fourier samples and η is the minimal distance between the generalized spikes. In the “well-conditioned” regime Nη≫1, we provide upper bounds for first-order perturbation of the solution to the corresponding least-squares problem. In the near-colliding, or “super-resolution” regime Nη→0 with a single cluster, we propose a natural regularization scheme based on decimating the samples – essentially increasing the separation η – and demonstrate the effectiveness and near-optimality of this scheme in practice.},

In many of these applications, the entries of the Hankel matrix are only known up to a certain precision. We study the sensitivity of the nonlinear application mapping the vector of Hankel entries to its generalized eigenvalues. A basic tool in this study is a result on the condition number of Vandermonde matrices with not necessarily real abscissas which are possibly row-scaled.},

  Abstract                 = {{The response of many dynamical systems to an impulse is a linear combination of decaying cosines. The frequencies of the cosines have generally been estimated in geophysics by periodogram analysis and little formal indication of uncertainty has been provided. This work presents an estimation procedure by the methods of complex demodulation and nonlinear regression that specifically incorporates in the basic model the decaying aspect of the cosines (periodogram analysis does not). The use of plots of the instantaneous phase as a function of time is shown to greatly enhance resolution. Expressions for the variances of eigenfrequencies, amplitudes, phases and damping constants Q are derived by non-linear least-squares. The results are illustrated, for the problem of the free oscillations of the Earth, by computations with the record made at Trieste of the Chilean earthquake of 1960 May 22. Sample values are periods and standard errors of 737.79 ± 0.13 s, 506.25 ± 0.13 s and 429.60 ± 0.14 s for 0T8, 0T13 and 0T16 with Q values and standard errors of 200 ± 14, 230 ± 28 and 215 ± 30, respectively.}},

abstract = {We present a procedure that adds a number of desirable features to standard exponential analysis algorithms, among which output reliability, a divide-and-conquer approach, the automatic detection of the exponential model order, robustness against some outliers, and the possibility to parallelize the analysis. The key enabler for these features is the introduction of uniform sub-Nyquist sampling through decimation of the dense signal data. We actually make use of possible aliasing effects to recondition the problem statement rather than that we avoid aliasing. In Section 2 the standard exponential analysis is described, including a sensitivity analysis. In Section 3 the ingredients for the new approach are collected, of which good use is made in Section 4 where we essentially bring everything together in what we call VEXPA. Some numerical examples of the new procedure illustrate in Section 5 that the additional features are indeed realized and that VEXPA is a valuable add-on to any stand-alone exponential analysis. While returning a lot of additional output, it maintains a favourable comparison to the CRLB of the underlying method, for which we here choose a matrix pencil method. Moreover, the output reliability of VEXPA is similar to that of atomic norm minimization, whereas its computational complexity is far less.}

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops a mathematical theory of super-resolution. Broadly speaking, super-resolution is the problem of recovering the fine details of an object—the high end of its spectrum—from coarse scale information only—from samples at the low end of the spectrum. Suppose we have many point sources at unknown locations in [0,1] and with unknown complex-valued amplitudes. We only observe Fourier samples of this object up to a frequency cutoff fc. We show that one can super-resolve these point sources with infinite precision—i.e., recover the exact locations and amplitudes—by solving a simple convex optimization problem, which can essentially be reformulated as a semidefinite program. This holds provided that the distance between sources is at least 2/fc. This result extends to higher dimensions and other models. In one dimension, for instance, it is possible to recover a piecewise smooth function by resolving the discontinuity points with infinite precision as well. We also show that the theory and methods are robust to noise. In particular, in the discrete setting we develop some theoretical results explaining how the accuracy of the super-resolved signal is expected to degrade when both the noise level and the super-resolution factor vary. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of determining the order of a parametric model from a noisy signal based on the geometry of the space. More specifically, we do this using the nontrivial angles between the candidate signal subspace model and the noise subspace. The proposed principle is closely related to the subspace orthogonality property known from the MUSIC algorithm, and we study its properties and compare it to other related measures. For the problem of estimating the number of complex sinusoids in white noise, a computationally efficient implementation exists, and this problem is therefore considered in detail. In computer simulations, we compare the proposed method to various well-known methods for order estimation. These show that the proposed method outperforms the other previously published subspace methods and that it is more robust to the noise being colored than the previously published methods.},

  Abstract                 = {An important hurdle in multi-exponential analysis is the correct detection of the number of components in a multi-exponential signal and their subsequent identification. This is especially difficult if one or more of these terms are faint and/or covered by noise. We present an approach to tackle this problem and illustrate its usefulness in motor current signature analysis (MCSA), relaxometry (in FLIM and MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The approach is based on viewing the exponential analysis as a Padé approximation problem and makes use of some well-known theorems from Padé approximation theory. We show how to achieve a clear separation of signal and noise by computing sufficiently high order Padé approximants, thus modeling both the signal and the noise, rather than filtering out the noise at an earlier stage and return a low order approximant. We illustrate the usefulness of the approach in different practical situations, where some exponential components are difficult to detect and retrieve because they are either faint compared to the other signal elements or contained in a cluster of similar exponential components.},

The technique does not suffer the curse of dimensionality and only needs \$O((d+1)n)\$ samples for the analysis of an \$n\$-sparse expression. It does not require a prior estimate of the sparsity \$n\$ of the \$d\$-variate exponential sum. The method can work with sub-Nyquist sampled data and offers a validation step, which is very useful in low SNR conditions. A favorable computation cost results from the fact that \$d\$ independent smaller systems are solved instead of one large system incorporating all measurements simultaneously. So the method easily lends itself to a parallel execution. Our motivation to develop the technique comes from 2-D and 3-D radar imaging and is therefore illustrated on such examples. }

These Loewner matrices are closely connected with the Hankel matrices that are usually employed for signal recovery. Due to the construction of the Loewner matrices via an adaptive selection of index sets, the MPM is stabilized. ESPIRA achieves similar recovery results for exact data as ESPRIT and the MPM, but with less computational effort.

	abstract = { Padé approximation is considered from the point of view of robust methods of numerical linear algebra, in particular, the singular value decomposition. This leads to an algorithm for practical computation that bypasses most problems of solution of nearly-singular systems and spurious pole-zero pairs caused by rounding errors, for which a MATLAB code is provided. The success of this algorithm suggests that there might be variants of Padé approximation that are pointwise convergent as the degrees of the numerator and denominator increase to \$\infty\$, unlike traditional Padé approximants, which converge only in measure or capacity. }

It is shown that problems with infinite (pseudo)eigenvalues are elegantly treated in this framework. For such problems stereographic projection onto the Riemann sphere is shown to provide a convenient way to visualize pseudospectra. Lower bounds for the distance to the nearest nonregular polynomial and the nearest uncontrollable dth order system (with equality for standard state-space systems) are obtained in terms of pseudospectra, showing that pseudospectra are a fundamental tool for reasoning about matrix polynomials in areas such as control theory. How and why to incorporate linear structure into pseudospectra is also discussed by example.},

(BIT 39 (4) (1999) 646) for computing all the zeros of an analytic function that lie inside the unit circle. A new perturbation result for generalized eigenvalue problems allows us to obtain a detailed upper bound for the error between the zeros and their approximations. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that such an error estimate is presented for any quadrature method for computing zeros of analytic functions. Numerical experiments illustrate our results.},

Their application on structural components requires a confident mechanical design taking into account the sensitivity of the mechanical response to both temperature T and relative humidity H. In this paper, the constitutive model already developed by the authors (Launay et al., 2011) is applied to describe the non-linear time-dependent behaviour of a PA66-GF35 under various hygrothermal conditions. The extensive experimental database involves testing conditions under and above the glass transition temperature Tg. An equivalence principle between temperature and relative humidity is applied and validated, since the non-linear mechanical response is shown to depend only on the temperature gap T-Tg(H)."

abstract = { Microwave sensor technology is widely accepted as a non-destructive and hygienic means for food evaluation and analysis. However, its applications concentrate on in-lab investigations, which are not widely applied for on-line measurement in food industry. Motivated by the rapid progress of microwave technologies and the lack of on-line measurement systems in industry, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of microwave sensors for food measurement, define the technological gap, and suggest the potential solutions. With a brief introduction to the fundamentals, classification and analysis of the traditional methods and technologies are presented, followed by a discussion of calibration and decision-making methods. Based on the analysis of the cutting-edge microwave sensing technologies, the limitations and challenges facing the present studies are identified. Then, focusing on some new emerging technologies including Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits, antenna array and System on Chip Ultra-Wide Band pulse-based time domain systems, the feasibility and prospective of potential solutions in this particular area are suggested. In addition, integration of emerging Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and new design concepts of the sensor system concerning the practical use for smart manufacturing are also illustrated. The potentiality of the suggested new emerging technologies and integration of ICT to satisfy future digitised industry will be inspirational and of interest to researchers of both microwave engineering and food sectors. }

Thus, the blessing of compositionality mitigates the curse of dimensionality. On the other hand, a theorem called good propagation of errors allows to "lift" theorems about shallow networks to those about deep networks with an appropriate choice of norms, smoothness, etc. We illustrate this in three contexts where each channel in the deep network calculates a spherical polynomial, a non-smooth ReLU network, or another zonal function network related closely with the ReLU network.}

abstract = {We propose model order selection methods for autoregressive (AR) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) time-series modeling based on ImageNet classifications with a 2-dimensional convolutional neural network (2-D CNN). We designed two models for two realistic scenarios: (1) a general model which emulates the scenario that validation and test datasets do not necessarily have the same dynamics as the training data, (2) a specific model which emulates the opposite scenario—the validation and test datasets share the dynamics of the training data. The results were compared to those of both Akaike Information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information criterion (BIC). Using simulation examples, we trained 2-D CNN-based Inception-v3 and ResNet50-v2 models for either AR or ARMA order selection for each of the two scenarios. The proposed ResNet50-v2 to use both time-frequency and the original time series data outperformed AIC and BIC for all scenarios. For the general model, the average of relative error reduction (ARER) when compared to the BIC method in the clean and three noisy environments was 19.07\% (±14.22\%) for the AR order for an AR process, and 5.67\% (±2.83\%) for the ARMA order for an ARMA process. The ARERs significantly improved to 73.92\% (±30.95\%) and 65.58\% (±38.61\%) for the AR and ARMA models, respectively, for the specific model scenario.}

In several papers, decimation is proposed as a way to increase the performance of subspace-based parameter estimation methods, in the case of oversampling (Signal Process. 63(3) (1997) 211; IEEE Signal Process. Lett. 4(2) (1997) 49; in: Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), Vol. V, Salt Lake City, UT, USA, May 7–11, 2001, pp. 3073–3076). In this paper, three decimative versions of the HTLS-method (J. Magn. Resonance A 110(2) (1994) 228), a subspace-based parameter estimation technique that operates directly on the data matrix, are derived and compared. Monte-Carlo simulation experiments show the influence of decimation on the statistical accuracy and the computational complexity of the algorithms.},

	abstract = {The recovery of signal parameters from noisy sampled data is a fundamental problem in digital signal processing. In this paper, we consider the following spectral analysis problem: Let f be a real-valued sum of complex exponentials. Determine all parameters of f, i.e., all different frequencies, all coefficients, and the number of exponentials from finitely many equispaced sampled data of f. This is a nonlinear inverse problem. In this paper, we present new results on an approximate Prony method (APM) which is based on [1]. In contrast to [1], we apply matrix perturbation theory such that we can describe the properties and the numerical behavior of the APM in detail. The number of sampled data acts as regularization parameter. The first part of APM estimates the frequencies and the second part solves an overdetermined linear Vandermonde-type system in a stable way. We compare the first part of APM also with the known ESPRIT method. The second part is related to the nonequispaced fast Fourier transform (NFFT). Numerical experiments show the performance of our method.}

  Abstract                 = {In spectral estimation, one has to determine all parameters of an exponential sum for finitely many (noisy) sampled data of this exponential sum. Frequently used methods for spectral estimation are MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification) and ESPRIT (Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Technique). For a trigonometric polynomial of large sparsity, we present a new sparse fast Fourier transform by shifted sampling and using MUSIC resp. ESPRIT, where the ESPRIT based method has lower computational cost. Later this technique is extended to a new reconstruction of a multivariate trigonometric polynomial of large sparsity for given (noisy) values sampled on a reconstructing rank-1 lattice. Numerical experiments illustrate the high performance of these procedures.},

An innovative multi-frequency (MF) fully non-linear inverse scattering (IS) technique exploiting the integration of a conjugate-gradient (CG) solver within the iterative multi-scaling approach (IMSA) is proposed. Representative results from numerical test cases are presented to provide the interested readers with some indications on the effectiveness, as well as the current limitations, of the proposed approach when directly compared to a state-of-the-art frequency-hopping (FH) based method formulated in the same framework. Such a validation points out that if, on the one hand, the proposed MF strategy is computationally more efficient than the FH one, on the other hand, it turns out to be less reliable and accurate in several situations."

abstract = {There has been a tremendous increase in applications of the inverse problem framework to parameter estimation in magnetic resonance. Attempting to capture both the basics of this formalism and modern developments would require an article of inordinate length. Therefore, in the following, we provide basic material as a practical introduction to the topic and an entree to the literature. First, we describe the formulation of linear and nonlinear inverse problems, with an emphasis on signal equations arising in magnetic resonance. We then describe the Fredholm equation of the first kind as a paradigm for these problems. This is followed by much more detailed considerations for determining solutions in the linear case, including central concepts such as condition number, regularization, and stability. Solution methods for nonlinear inverse problems are described next, followed by a treatment of their stability and regularization. Finally, we provide an introduction to compressed sensing, with signal reconstruction formulated as the solution to an inverse problem, making use of much of the previous material. Throughout, the emphasis is on outlines of the theory and on numerical examples, rather than on mathematical rigor and completeness.},

abstract = {Summary Structural health monitoring (SHM) has been becoming a key element of monitoring and maintenance in modern and smart cities with critical infrastructures. Within the past decade, SHM approaches are widely used in bridges, roads, skyscrapers, critical facilities, and buildings to enhance the public safety and cost efficiencies of infrastructure maintenance under extreme events, such as earthquakes. Several advanced wave-based methods, such as sliding discrete Fourier transform, discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and Hilbert transform were broadly used to detect different failure modes of systems. One of the most important deficiencies associated with the state-of-the-art approaches is their high level of sensitivity to the sampling frequency, measurement noise, and damage-induced pulse parameters. To fill this technical gap, for the first time, this paper proposes a high-frequency damage detection approach based on the short-time matrix pencil method (STMPM) that has been used in electrical engineering lately. The advantage of STMPM compared with the similar approaches is using the complex frequencies that are not used before in damage detection applications. In this study, pounding between two adjacent buildings is considered as a case study of high-frequency damage scenario. The proposed STMPM-based detection technique is compared with DWT with commonly used mother wavelets. According to the simulation results, the STMPM-based detection is more robust compared with DWT-based techniques and has lower sensitivity to the noise parameters and sampling rate.},

	abstract = {The single-model approach to model selection based on information criteria, such as AIC or BIC, is omnipresent in the signal processing literature. However, any single-model approach picks up only one model and hence misses the potentially significant information associated with the other models fitted to the data. In our opinion this is a drawback: indeed, depending on the application, even the true model structure (assuming that there was one) may not be the best choice for the intended use of the model. The multi-model approach does not suffer from such a problem: using nothing more than the values of AIC or BIC it estimates the a posteriori probabilities of each model under consideration and then it goes on to use all fitted models in a weighted manner according to their posterior likelihoods. We show via a numerical study that the multi-model approach can outperform the single-model approach in terms of statistical accuracy, without unduly increasing the computational burden. The first goal of this paper is to advocate the multi-model approach. A second goal is to introduce some guidelines for numerically studying the performance of a model selection rule.}

The conference has been being a bi-annual event and has been hosted by sixteen cities from four continents. Throughout these 30 years, researchers and practitioners witnessed the analog paper printout to digital era that enables very efficient collection, processing and 3D imaging of large amount of data required in GPR imaging in infrastructure. GPR has systematically progressed forward from “Locating and Testing” to “Imaging and Diagnosis” with the Holy Grail of ’Seeing the unseen’ becoming a reality. This paper reviews the latest development of the GPR’s primary infrastructure applications, namely buildings, pavements, bridges, tunnel liners, geotechnical and buried utilities. We review both the ability to assess structure as built character and the ability to indicate the state of deterioration. Finally, we outline the path to a more rigorous development in terms of standardization, accreditation, and procurement policy.}

We simulate RF sources and receivers placed outside the room to generate observation data with objects randomly placed inside the room. We experiment with two types of neural networks and use an 80-20 train-test split for reconstruction and classification.}

  Abstract                 = {Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation refers to the process of retrieving the direction information of several electromagnetic waves/sources from the outputs of a number of receiving antennas that form a sensor array. DOA estimation is a major problem in array signal processing and has wide applications in radar, sonar, wireless communications, etc. With the development of sparse representation and compressed sensing, the last decade has witnessed a tremendous advance in this research topic. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of these sparse methods for DOA estimation, with a particular highlight on the recently developed gridless sparse methods, e.g., those based on covariance fitting and the atomic norm. Several future research directions are also discussed.},
